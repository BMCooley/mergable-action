## Code in Master

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript
```bash
$ npm run build
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos.  We will create a releases branch and only checkin production modules (core in this case). 

Comment out node_modules in .gitignore and create a releases/v1 branch
```bash
# comment out in distribution branches
# node_modules/
```

```bash
$ git checkout -b releases/v1
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
```

```bash
$ npm prune --production
$ git add node_modules
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing the releases/v1 branch

```yaml
uses: actions/typescript-action@releases/v1
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/javascript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and tested action

```yaml
uses: actions/typescript-action@v1
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```
